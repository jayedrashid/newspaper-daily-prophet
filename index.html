                The basic concepts of magic are fairly simple — even a two-year-old wizard can do some form of magic —
                but the inherent power and potential for misuse are great indeed. It is for this reason that promising
                young witches and wizards are sent to schools of magic, such as Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
                Wizardry to refine their craft and learn the art and responsibility of their power. <p>There, they learn
                    a variety of magical specialities, general theory and the history of magic in their world.

                Those unable to do magic who are born to magical parents are known as Squibs; this is when the
                non-magical gene resurfaces, causing the offspring to therefore be non-magical. A witch or wizard born
                to Muggle parents is known as a Muggle-born. This is when a Muggle family is descended from a Squib, and
                the wizarding gene resurfaces many generations later. Muggle-borns are far more common than Squibs,
                which may be a feature of the disparate sizes of the Muggle and wizarding populations.</p>

                    <span class="citation">"Don’t let the muggles get you down." — Ron Weasley</span> The term "muggle"
                    is trademarked. As we all know, it belongs to the Harry Potter universe describing someone who isn't
                    a wizard or witch. In geocaching, it refers to someone not aware of geocaching. For commercial
                    purposes, this word can't be legally used.

                    Tom Riddle, a Muggle. ... Harry himself is a half-blood, since his pure-blood father, James, married
                    a Muggle-born witch named Lily, and his maternal grandparents were Muggles.</p>

                <p>IDobby suffered a period of unemployment, during which he was often ostracised for having no "proper
                    shame" in regards to being out of work. He was generally pleased to be free, although he did enjoy
                    working as a hobby. Dobby was ecstatic to be out of the abusive hands of the Malfoys, but equally
                    pleased to join the Hogwarts staff. At Hogwarts he could come and go as he liked, did not have many
                    tasks, and those he did have were fairly simple. Dobby requested some compensations for his work and
                    eventually he and Dumbledore came to an agreement.

                Dobby went on to work in the kitchens at Hogwarts, for which he was paid one Galleon a week and got one
                day off each month. He had been accompanied to Hogwarts by his friend Winky (who had recently been
                dismissed) and so began Dobby's new happy life nearby his closest friends: Harry, Ron, and Hermione.</p>

                    occasionally lead to trouble but – Aragog's man-eating family aside – Hagrid's friendship is a prize

                When the Dark Wizard Lord Voldemort learned that his archenemy Harry Potter had secretly ventured into
                the castle to locate and destroy one of his final Horcruxes, he ordered every single Death Eater and
                dark creature that had ever pledged loyalty to him to launch a massive attack on the school.

                Dumbledore's Army then communicated the need to fight to the Order of the Phoenix and their other allies
                within the British Ministry of Magic, leading to a large-scale battle. Voldemort led his forces from the
                Shrieking Shack in Hogsmeade; while Harry Potter, Kingsley Shacklebolt and Minerva McGonagall led the
                defenders of Hogwarts. Voldemort also announced that he wanted Harry Potter to surrender himself by
                midnight.</p>

                </div>
                The Sorting Hat was a sentient magical hat at Hogwarts that determined which of the four school Houses
                each new student belonged most to. These four Houses were Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
                Slytherin. The Sorting Hat originally belonged to Godric Gryffindor, one of the four founders of
                Hogwarts.</p>

                <p>It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I suppose the new arrivals from
                    Woking also helped to restore confidence. At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent
                    movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of
                    the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken. Vertical black figures in twos and threes
                    would advance, stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular
                    crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns. I, too, on my side began to
                    move towards the pit.</p>

                <p>Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, and heard the clatter of
                    hoofs and the gride of wheels. I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples. And then, within
                    thirty yards of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of
                    men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.</p>

                    <span class="citation">"Don’t let the muggles get you down." — Ron Weasley</span> Muggle-borns
                    inherit magic from a distant ancestor; they are descended from Squibs who have married Muggles and
                    whose families had lost the knowledge of their wizarding legacy. The magic resurfaces unexpectedly
                    many generations later.
                </p>
                <p>Because of the heritable traits of magic, Muggle-born siblings are possible, as in the case of Colin
                    and Dennis Creevey. However, this is not always the case, as Lily Evans' sister Petunia was a

                leaves Harry with a scar on his head in the shape of a lightning bolt. Nearly every witch or wizard
